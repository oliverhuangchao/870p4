Project No:	4
Project Due date:	Oct. 21th, 2014

Project basic description:
1. In this project, I try to use Factory function to create more sprite including multiSprite and singleSprite.
2. MultiSprite has 12 frames and it can change it fly way while they touch left and right screen
3. The view port is smaller than the world size.
4. I also achieve the zoom function: When the bird touch the left side, it can change its size; When touch the right side, it will change back to the original size


Extra & Special function:

When you click 'e' button. The bird will eat the flying pumpkin and then the eaten pumking will fly around the bird in circle.

As default, there will be two birds. So you will se one of the birds will eat more pumking then the other. It is just like a game. 

However, you should wait 10-20s to see the result very obversly.




Project Problem:
There sill be some memory leak in my code. I still need to fix them.
It may caused by sdl_surface, I think.

PS:
1. The pumpking: drawn by myself.
2. The background image: reference is 'https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/halloween-2012-mad-king-tower.jpg'
